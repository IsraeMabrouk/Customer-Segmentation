Welcome to the Customer Segmentation Project repository!
This project focuses on segmenting customers for a large automobile company, leveraging data-driven insights to enhance marketing and service strategies. By employing advanced data science techniques, including machine learning algorithms, we aim to categorize the customer base into distinct segments, providing the company with a deeper understanding of their clientele.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Exploration:** Dive into the world of the automobile industry with an in-depth exploration of customer data, uncovering patterns and trends that drive business decisions.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Implement cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to perform customer segmentation, allowing the company to tailor marketing strategies to the specific needs and behaviors of each segment.

- **Visualization:** Utilize powerful visualization tools to present the segmentation results in a clear and comprehensible manner, facilitating decision-making for stakeholders.

- **Scalability:** Develop a scalable and reproducible framework that can be extended to handle larger datasets or adapted for similar segmentation tasks in diverse industries.


## Techniques Used
- **RFM Analysis:** Leveraging Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value metrics to gain insights into customer behavior and segment them accordingly.

- **K-Means Clustering:** Employing the K-Means algorithm for clustering customers based on features derived from the RFM analysis. This helps in grouping customers with similar characteristics.

- **Elbow Method:** Utilizing the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means, ensuring meaningful segmentation.

- **Silhouette Score:** Employing the Silhouette Score to validate the quality of the clusters formed, aiding in the assessment of segmentation effectiveness
